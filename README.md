First repository for tutorial purposes
Application/Software Developer originally trained in RPGLE, CLLE, and IBM DB2. Since completion of training, I have learned SQL, HTML, CSS, PHP, Ruby, Python, Javascript, and VBA. While I am still learning and have a long way to go in some of those languages, I will be continually developing my skills in these languages until I am comfortable tackling problems in each language.
